I had this PHP idea because of a lower level coding pattern I've used in Node.js applications and scripts that looks something like this:

```javascript
// source some libs:
import { createServer } from 'express'
import React from 'react'

// and then you do something sometimes asynchronous with them like this:
process.nextTick(() => {
  const app = createServer(() => {})
  app.listen(3000)
})
```
It's a little meta but basically `you import stuff and then do stuff with it later`. It could potentially be an approach that if taken at the start of the execution of a function with that function being the scope there could be some analysis to be had there. What if there was a new syntax improvement that would facilitate some low-level performance improvements via some hinting that does stuff like asynchronous calls that *start* doing stuff, by doing some hinting at the beginning of a method using a new token `hint` - like this?:

```php
<?php

class HomeController extends Controller {
  public function __construct (

    private ContentRepository $repository
  
  ) {}

  public function index (Request $request) {
    hint {

      // some function calls
      curl_init,
      curl_setopt,
      curl_exec,
      curl_close,

      // some constants
      CURLOPT_URL,
      CURLOPT_HEADER,
      CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER,
      CURLOPT_POST,
      CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS

      // some properties
      $this->repository
      
    }

    // at this point of the method it already knows a lot about what is *about* to be executed
    $content = $this->repository->loadAll();

    // at this point, it could have already ran some curl logic
    $ch = curl_init();

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.example.com/");
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1);

    $data = array(
      'username' => 'foo',
      'password' => 'bar'
    );

    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $data);

    $contents = curl_exec($ch);

    curl_close($ch);

    return $this->render('index');
  }
}
```

Using `hint` could be a more strict approach or a more flexible one, allowing multiple types of tokens like function calls, constants, and objects. At a lower level, at the start of a function call when it hits `hint`, it could have certain per-method performance improvements that are made possible by the ability to more effectively manage what's in memory. You could even have the `hint` block be required to have each declaration be in order, so that the declarations are accessed sequentially. Sort of like a `hint` array that is a forecast of what order each function is going to be executed in. Here's another example:

```php
<?php

class HomeController extends Controller {
  public function __construct (

    private ContentRepository $repository
  
  ) {}

  public function index (Request $request) {
    hint {

      // first function call
      str_replace,

      // second function call
      rand,

      // third function call
      json_encode

    }

    $header = str_replace('', '', $request->header1); // first function call
    $number = rand(1, 10); // second function call
    $json = json_encode([
      'statusCode' => 200
    ]); // third function call

    return $this->render('index', $json);
  }
}
```

Interesting! (to me) :)
