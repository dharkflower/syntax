This would need to be written in C, in php-src. An extension would probably work too. Pretend some of this is C code. This example has `pcntl` as a dependency.

Let's imagine some kind of simple web server like this. It's untested and it's not perfect but you'll see the point, it spawns a bunch of PHP threads using `pcntl` that all run on different ports at different process priorities:

```php
<?php

$multiplier = 10;
$max = 100;

foreach ($i = 1; $i * $multiplier <= $max; $i++) {

  $pid = pcntl_fork();

  if ($pid == -1) {
  
    die('could not fork');
  
  } else if ($pid) { // we are the parent thread

    pcntl_wait($status);

  } else { // we are a child thread

    // set the port
    $port = 3000 + $i;

    // set the priority for this thread/port
    pcntl_setpriority($i * $multiplier, getmypid());

    while (TRUE) {

      listen($port, function() {

        require_once 'autoload.php';

      });

    }
  }
}

```

An example of what this does could be explained with a setup using Apache2 - some kind of reverse proxy that would divert requests to specific ports based on desired priority. It's a little strange, but at its most basic form it's the start of a type of load balancer. Does that make sense?

If load balancing was handled natively by PHP like this, what if there was a new syntax token called `migrate` that worked something like this?:

```php
<?php

class HomeController extends Controller {

  public function __construct (

    private ContentRepository $repository
  
  ) {}

  #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
  public function index (

    Request $request,
    User $user

  ) : Response {

    // migrate this thread to thread listener running at priority 50 on port 3005
    migrate 50;

    // this line runs at priority 50 on port 3005
    $content = $this->repository->findAll();

    // migrate this thread to thread listener running at priority 10 on port 3001
    migrate 10;

    // this line runs at priority 10 on port 3001
    $json = json_encode([
      'statusCode' => 200
    ]);

    // migrate this thread to the thread listener running at default priority on port 3000
    migrate default;

    // this line runs at the default priority on port 3000
    return $this->render('index', [
      'json' => $json,
      'content' => $content
    ]);
  }
}
```

It would essentially allow you to make tiny little micro-suggestions of where, or at what priority, to run more granular parts of PHP, if you could figure out how to have a single request be able to access the same request headers and information from different threads.

It could potentially be used as a property like this:

```php
<?php

class HomeController extends Controller {

  // property sets priority of all routes
  migrate 50;

  public function __construct (

    private ContentRepository $repository
  
  ) {}

  #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
  public function index (

    Request $request,
    User $user

  ) : Response {

    // this runs on thread listener running at priority 50 on port 3005

    $json = json_encode([
      'statusCode' => 200
    ]);

    return $this->render('index', [
      'json' => $json
    ]);

  }

  #[Route('/about', name: 'about')]
  public function about (

    Request $request,
    User $user

  ) : Response {

    // this runs on thread listener running at priority 50 on port 3005

    $content = $this->repository->findAll();

    return $this->render('about', [
      'content' => $content
    ]);

  }
}
```

It could potentially use UNIX sockets instead of TCP sockets. It would have to track where that process's state is in memory but if it could pass some kind of identifier from thread to thread it might be able to work as an independent yet unified system.
