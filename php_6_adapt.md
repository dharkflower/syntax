I don't think this is a threat to a more standard architecture for responding to load like Symfony Messenger async processing could, it's just some code saving that could have some under-the-hood speed improvements if harnessed correctly and some simplifications for people coding math-heavy applications like load balancers in PHP.

```php
<?php

class HomeController {

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // okay, so how you *could* currently do load calculation is like this:
        $iterations = 0;

        // you'd have to run a shell command like top or something
        $load = getload();
        $load = 4; // hardcode this for now
        
        if ($load < 5) {
            $iterations = 100;
        }

        else {
            $iterations = 75;
        }

        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

            // this block runs either 100 times if the computer is pretty freed up or else 75 times if it's not

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
}

```
That's cool and everything - adapting PHP code to load, but what if we abstracted some of it with some new tokens to inform some type of new under-the-hood load balancing stuff about what's important to run and what's not? I imagine it working like this:
```php
<?php

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // new `adapt` token, takes a ceiling parameter so it knows the max number of $iterations
        $iterations = adapt 100;

        // but when called like this after setting $iterations to an `adapt` variable...
        adapt $iterations 3 / 4;

        // now, $iterations is 75 if the load is high
        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

            // this block runs 75 times

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
```
### what's the point?
It's potentially an AI concept that for every "forgivable, bendable, stretchable" variable that determines things like iterations there is an opportunity to make decisions on not just what and when to think but when *not to* in the name of performance. It's deductive reasoning. The quicker you kill zombie threads the quicker you can spin up other asynchronous stuff.

When you start to think of it as a sort of limiter type thing, you can start to actually come up with some pretty weird `adapt` type stuff that simplifies it up:
```php
<?php

$iterations = adapt 100;
for ($i = 0; $i < adapt $iterations 3 / 4; $i++) {
    // 100 times or 75 times, depending on load
}

$iterations = adapt 100;
adapt $iterations default {
    // 100 times
}

adapt $iterations 3 / 4 {
    // 75 times
}
```
It's almost like a switch case or a CSS3 keyframes transition. It could end up being something like this:
```php
<?php

adapt ($iterations) {
    load < 6:
        // run 100 times
        break;
    default:
        // runs 75 times
        break;
}
```
The coolest thing about this is that `adapt` doesn't only have to determine iterations; that's just an example of adapting an important variable. But adapt could provide a pretty smooth API to mathematically react to things based on things that you sometimes can't predict like "number of requests coming through" or how everything on the server is running and being coordinated.
