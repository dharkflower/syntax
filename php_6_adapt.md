I don't think this is a threat to a more standard architecture like Symfony Messenger kind of stuff, I think it might even compliment it. It's just some code golf that could have some under-the-hood speed improvements if harnessed correctly and some simplifications for people coding math-heavy and reactive applications - like a load balancer, for example.

```php
<?php

class HomeController {

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // okay, so how you *could* currently do load calculation is like this:
        $iterations = 0;

        // you'd have to run a shell command like top or something
        $load = getload();
        $load = 4; // hardcode this for now
        
        if ($load < 5) {
            $iterations = 100;
        }

        else {
            $iterations = 75;
        }

        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

            // this block runs either 100 times if the computer is pretty freed up or else 75 times if it's not

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
}

```
What if we abstracted some of the mathematical type code we write with a new type/token called `adapt` that is meant to be a sort of reactive type? I imagine it working something like this:
```php
<?php

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // new `adapt` type
        $iterations = (adapt) 100 75 50 25;

        // now, $iterations is 75 if the load is high
        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
```
### What's the point?
It's potentially a concept that actually exists in the AI realm; for every "forgivable, bendable, stretchable" variable that determines things like compute-intensive iterations there is an opportunity to make decisions on not just what to think but when *not to* and throw in the towel in the name of performance. It's logical deductive reasoning, if you think about it - instead of trying to summon AI from the ground. The quicker you kill zombie threads the quicker you can spin up those types of asynchronous processes that just *think*.

It's almost like a switch case or a CSS3 keyframes transition. It could end up being something like this:
```php
<?php

adapt ($iterations) {
    load > 4:
        // run 75 times
        break;
    default:
        // runs 100 times
        break;
}
```
The coolest thing about this is that `adapt` doesn't only have to determine iterations; that's just an example of adapting an important iteration variable. But `adapt` could provide a pretty smooth API to mathematically react to things based on things that you sometimes can't predict like "number of requests coming through" or how everything on the server is running and being coordinated.
