### adapt
This is just some code golf that could have some under-the-hood speed improvements if harnessed correctly and provide some simplifications for people trying to create logic that pivots off of the state of other things.

Take this snippet into consideration:

```php
<?php

class HomeController {

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // hardcode to 4
        $load = getload();
        
        if ($load < 5) {
            $iterations = 100;
        }

        else {
            $iterations = 75;
        }

        // runs 100 times
        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
}

```
What if we abstracted out some of the mathematical type code we write with a new type/token called `adapt` that is meant to dynamically accomplish the same thing as above? It could select a value from a set of numbers based on criteria like load.

It's potentially a concept that actually exists in the AI realm; for every "forgivable, bendable, stretchable" variable that determines something like number of compute-intensive iterations to run there is an opportunity to make micro-decisions on not just what to computer think but when *not to* think and throw in the towel in the name of performance. It makes way for other computations by arming the currently executing script with reasoning that smoothly knows when to limit itself, if you think about it; logically calculating what zombie threads to kill off is a form of thinking backwards.

The coolest thing about this is that `adapt` doesn't only have to determine iterations, and wouldn't actually need to select based on load; that's just an example of adapting an important iteration variable. Basically `adapt` could abstract out a pretty smooth API to mathematically react to things and pivot based on other things generally.

- I would want the syntax to be able to define a shell command to run to determine adaption criteria
- I would also want the syntax to be able to define a class to automatically run as an adaption criteria definition determiner

```php
<?php

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // new: be able to programatically define adapt values into an arr
        $values = [
            100,
            75,
            50,
            25,
        ];

        // changes this
        $iterations = (adapt) 100 75 50 25;

        // to this
        $iterations = (adapt) $values;

        // but we need to be able to define adaptation criteria one of two ways:
        $criteria = 'top -b -n 1 | grep "load average" | awk "{print $10, $11, $12}"'; // a shell command, example command to determine system load
        $iterations = (adapt) $values $criteria;

        // or through a reference to an adaptation criteria determiner class
        $iterations = (adapt) $values SystemLoadAdaptation::class;

        // runs either 100, 75, 50, or 25 times
        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {
        }

        // awesome example, abstracts granular control over the number of iterations to run to an external Node.js script
        $criteria = 'node /var/www/criteria/index.js';
        $iterations = (adapt) $values $criteria;

        // runs either 100, 75, 50, or 25 times, depending upon the result of the Node.js script
        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {
        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
```
