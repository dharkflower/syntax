8I don't think this is a threat to more standard architecture for responding to load like Symfony Messenger async processing could, it's just some code saving that could have some under-the-hood speed improvements and some simplifications for people using math-based load balancing in PHP.

```php
<?php

class HomeController {

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // okay, so how you *could* currently do pc load calculation is like this:
        $iterations = 0;

        // get some sort of number that represents PC load
        // you'd have to run a shell command like top or something
        $pcload = getpcload();
        $pcload = 4; // hardcode this for now
        
        if ($pcload < 5) {
            $iterations = 100;
        }

        else {
            $iterations = 75;
        }

        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

            // this block runs either 100 times if the computer is pretty freed up or else 75 times if it's not

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
}

```
That's cool and everything - adapting PHP code to PC load, but what if we abstracted some of it with some new tokens to inform some type of new under-the-hood load balancing stuff written in C. I imagine it working like this:
```php
<?php

    #[Route('/', name: 'index')]
    public function index (

        Request $request,
        User $user

    ) : Response {

        // new `adapt` token, takes a ceiling parameter so it knows the max number of $iterations
        $iterations = adapt 100;

        // but when called like this after setting $iterations to an `adapt` variable...
        adapt $iterations 3 / 4;

        // now, $iterations is 75
        // because PC load is let's say 6

        for ($i = 0; $i < $iterations; $i++) {

            // this block runs 75 times

        }

        return $this->render('index');
    }
```
### what's the point?
it's potentially an AI concept that lives deep in an ideology that for every "forgivable, bendable, stretchable" variable that determines iterations there is an opportunity to make decisions on not just what and when to think but when *not to* in the name of performance. The quicker you kill zombie threads the quicker you can spin up other asynchronous stuff.

when you start to think of it as a sort of limiter type thing, you can start to actually come up with some pretty weird `adapt` type stuff that simplifies it up
```php
<?php

for ($i = 0; $i < adapt $iterations; $i++) {
    // 75 times
}

adapt $i default {
    // 100 times
}

adapt $i = 3 / 4 {
    // 75 times
}
```
It's almost like a switch case or a CSS3 keyframes transition. It could end up being something like this:
```php
<?php

adapt ($iterations) {
    load < 6:
        // run 100 times
        break;
    default:
        // runs 75 times
        break;
}
```
